        <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dear Ms./Mr.,</p>
        <p>With a Bachelor degree of English with a Minor in Information Technology from UALR, I want to have the opportunity to join your team to show you how hard 
          working I am. I have over four years of experience in IT Workstation Support and have been very successful in delivering great customer service. I am confident
           I can offer my skills and experiences you require and would make a valuable addition to your company.</p>
          <p>I have had a passion for IT most of my life from playing video games to working with all different kinds of technology. As said in my resume, I have 4 years 
            of experience in IT Workstation Support. I have worked with many different types of computer programs such as: 
            Adobe, Microsoft products, Autodesk, and Windows operating systems. Other work I have done  is installed many printers, scanners, and set-ups for clients, 
                and have done lots of troubleshooting as well. </p>
          <p>In addiction to working in IT Workstation Support, I have also done some coding as well. Some coding I have done is with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I wish to provide your company with the skills and experiences that I have. With my skills and experiences, I can provide a new and different  
            point of view on your team. I would appreciate the opportunity to work at your company. 
            Thank you for your consideration.</p>
        <p>Thank you,</p>
        <p>Ana Lupton

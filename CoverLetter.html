        <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dear Miss/Mister,</p>
        <p>With over 4 years of experience in IT Workstation Support, I have been very successful in delivering great customer service. I am confident I can offer skills 
          and experiences you require and would make a valuable addition to your company.</p>
          <p>As said before and in my resume, I have 4 years of experience in IT Workstation Support. I have worked with many different types of computer programs such as: 
            Adobe, Microsoft products, Autodesk, and Windows operating systems. Other work I have done  is installed many pinters, scanners, and set-ups for clients, 
                and have done lots of troubleshooting as well. </p>
          <p>In addiction to working in IT Workstation Support, I have also done some coding as well. Some coding I have done is with:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I wish to provide your company with the skills and experience that I have. I would appreciate the opportunity to work at your company. 
            Thank you for your consideration.</p>
        <p>Thank you,</p>
